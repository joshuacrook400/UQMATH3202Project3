# UQMATH3202Project3

This is my responce to UQMATH3202 Project 3.

This is an example of a stochastic dynamic programming problem involving providing the optimal expected profit from a hypothetical gas cylinder supply depo. \
This Supply depo must supply a required number of 90kg cylinders regular clients and option to sell 45kg cylinders up to a maximum demand given (High or Low) which is only the chance of each scenario is known. Also storage limits and supply limits were implemented in this solution.
